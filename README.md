Here’s a **general-purpose `README.md`** template you can use for your open-source 3D model repository. It’s clear, professional, and flexible so you can adapt it as your collection grows.

# **Open Source 3D Models**

Welcome to my personal repository of **open-source 3D models**!
This collection is intended for makers, hobbyists, and professionals who want to explore, learn, or build on these designs.

All models in this repository are shared **freely** under an open license (see [License](#license)) to support the maker community and encourage collaboration.

---

## **Goals**

* Provide **clean, editable 3D models** for personal and educational use.
* Encourage **collaboration and contributions** from the community.
* Support **open hardware and maker projects** by making these resources accessible.
* Create a **living library** of designs for various tools, hobbies, and experiments.

* **`/models`** – The main folder containing categorized model files.
* **`/docs`** – Extra documentation, notes, or tutorials.
* **`README.md`** – This file, explaining usage and goals.
* **`LICENSE`** – License terms for using and modifying these models.

---

## **Supported Formats**

Most models will be provided in one or more of these formats:

* **STL** – Printable mesh for 3D printing
* **STEP** – Parametric CAD for editing in most platforms
* **F3D / SLDPRT / etc.** – Native files for Fusion 360, SolidWorks, or other CAD tools

---

## **How to Use**

1. Browse the `/models` folder to find what you need.
2. Download the desired format (`STL` for printing, `STEP` or `F3D` for editing).
3. Check the `/docs` folder for tips, guides, or build notes when available.

## **Contributing**

Contributions are welcome! Here’s how you can help:

* Submit **new models** or improvements.
* Share **print settings** or testing feedback.
* Report **issues or suggestions** via GitHub Issues.

Please follow the [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) if available.
